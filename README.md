## Web Development

  - ### Front-End Templates

    - [Vite + React + Tailwind](https://github.com/KrishGarg/vite-react-tailwind-jit-template): A traditional react starter app powered by vite and beautified by TailwindCss.

    - [ExpressJS Discord Oauth2](https://github.com/KrishGarg/OAuth2-Discord-ExpressJs): An express server, with routes made for Discord Oauth2.

  - ### Full-Stack Templates

- ## Hosting

  - ### Free Static Site Hosting

    - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
    - [Surge](https://surge.sh/)
    - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
    - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
    - [Render](https://render.com/)
    - [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
    - [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

  - ### Free Backend Hosting

    - ### Serverless
      - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
      - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Need to add payment details even for free serverless functions quota.
      - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
      - [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
    - ### Server-Based

      - [Railway](https://railway.app/)
      - [Render](https://render.com/)
      - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

    - [Deta](https://www.deta.sh/): This is a different kind of hosting where your code is ran in a server environment but with a 10s limit. So between serverless and server based. But it does have the most lenient plans including free plans for a key-value store named Deta Base and a media cloud storage named Deta Drive. I would say good for a simple Express api or a Flask app.

    - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): Serverless for backend.

    - [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/): Can add a `functions` directory to deploy serverless functions to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).
    - [Render](https://render.com/): Can host a static site and a web-service like an express separately.
    - [Railway](https://railway.app/): Only possible by SSR, in short, no CDN/Static Site hosting.
    - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/): Only possible by SSR, in short, no CDN/Static Site hosting.

# Contributing

Feel free to open a pull request and add more useful links. I didn't set-up auto linting and stuff as I don't know how to and I am too lazy to figure it out. Just please see the pattern and try to follow it.

You can add any development related useful link here, doesn't matter if it is anywhere close to web development. I myself am learning web development, so I could only add those but the goal for this repository is to add useful stuff for every development field.
