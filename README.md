# Contributing

Feel free to open a pull request and add more useful links. I didn't set-up auto linting and stuff as I don't know how to and I am too lazy to figure it out. Just please see the pattern and try to follow it.

You can add any development related useful link here, doesn't matter if it is anywhere close to web development. I myself am learning web development, so I could only add those but the goal for this repository is to add useful stuff for every development field.
